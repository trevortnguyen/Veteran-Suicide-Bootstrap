# Introduction
Suicide remains a critical public health issue in the United States, with a particular troubling disparity between veterans and civilians. Veterans, having traversed the complex landscape of military service, may face distinctive mental health challenges.

## How do the suicide rate of veterans and civilians differ, and how do the rates change over time?
Nonparametric bootstrapping will be performed for disparity and the U.S. Veteran Suicide Rates dataset will be used to answer the question. The dataset was found on Kaggle and was initially collected by News 21 — a journalism initiative at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University — in 2013 to publish data journalism reports tracking veteran suicides (<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/lovoo-v3-dating-app-user-profiles-and-statistics">`data source`</a>). The dataset contains 7 files, one for each year between 2005 and 2011.
